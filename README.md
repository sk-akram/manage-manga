Manga Manager is an android application designed to provide manga enthusiasts with an enhanced manga reading experience. The user-friendly interface allows users to select any manga pdf from their device and view and read them in the traditional manga format, from right to left.

One of its key features is the app's ability to remember the reader's progress. If the app is closed while reading a manga, it will pick up from where the user left off when they reopen it, ensuring a seamless reading experience.

Manga Manager also offers a full-screen reading option, immersing readers in the captivating world of their favorite manga series
